\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Concentration Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two similar samples of \ce{CaCO3} rocks were picked and weighed.
    \item The weight of a beaker was measured and the scale zeroed.
    \item 50.0mL of 1.0M \ce{HCl} was poured into the beaker.
    \item The weight of the \ce{HCl} and a \ce{CaCO3} rock combined was measured and recorded.
    \item The \ce{CaCO3} rock was dropped into the beaker.
    \item Weight measurements of the system were taken every 30 seconds for 5 minutes.
    \item The process was repeated with the other rock in 3.0M \ce{HCl}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Temperature and Surface Area Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 50.0mL of room temperature water was poured into two beakers, and 50.0mL of boiling water into another beaker.
    \item 3 denture tablets were picked and weighed.
    \item A beaker with water was zeroed on the scale.
    \item A denture tablet was dropped into the water and weight measurements were taken every 30 seconds for 5 minutes, stopping once fully dissolved.
    \item This was done 3 times. A control test with room temperature water. A heated test with boiling water, and a surface area test with a denture tablet crushed into a fine power.
\end{enumerate}
