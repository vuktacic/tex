\section{Purpose}
To investigate the effect concentration, temperature, and surface area have on the rate of reaction in the following two reactions:
\begin{align*}
    \reactionOne \\
    \reactionTwo
\end{align*}
The first reaction will be between Calcium Carbonate and Hydrochloric Acid, varying the concetration of the acid. The second reaction will be between the Citric Acid and Sodium Bicarbonate in a denture tablet, varying the temperature and surface area.
