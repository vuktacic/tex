\section{Purpose}
To investigate the effect concentration, temperature, and surface area have on the rate of reaction in the following two reactions:
\begin{align*}
    \ce{CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) &-> CO2(g) + CaCl2(aq) + H2O(l)} \\
    \ce{C6H8O7(aq) + 3NaHCO3(s) &-> 3H2O(l) + 3CO2(g) + Na3C6H5O7(aq) }
\end{align*}
The first reaction will be between Calcium Carbonate and Hydrochloric Acid, varying the concetration of the acid. The second reaction will be between the Citric Acid and Sodium Bicarbonate in a denture tablet, varying the temperature and surface area.
